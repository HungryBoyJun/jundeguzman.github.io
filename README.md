# Student Data Analyst
My name is Jun and I'm currently pivoting to become Data Analyst while pursuing a Master of Business Analytics & Artificial Intelligence (current GPA: 3.35) at Ontario Tech University. I have built strong foundational core literacies on coding, particularly in Python, SQL, and ML libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn.
