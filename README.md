I have built strong foundational core literacies on coding, particularly in Python, SQL, and ML libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn. Delivered measurable impact through automated reporting, data-driven decisions, and projects utilizing statistical, sentiment, and exploratory analysis.
